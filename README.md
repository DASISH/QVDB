DASISH QVDB - Question and Variable Database
============================================

### The primary aim and users

The Question Variable Database (QVDB) is under development as a searchable database with a broad public profile, which will give users access to survey questions in their original languages, the concepts they are based on, additional material used in the data collection, as well as variable and classification related metadata.

The primary aim of the tool is to support survey projects in their business processes, by facilitating reuse of metadata elements at different stages of the processes. The tool will also allow users from within the research community to browse the database (question, concept and variable mining) in order to design new research or to explore existing projects. Developed initially with the ESS in mind, the QVDB is designed to also serve projects external to DASISH. A goal for the QVDB is to interoperate with other systems and tools, and to act as a reusable model for other question banks.


### A selection of the most important functional requirements for the QVDB:

 * The QVDB should have a DDI - Lifecycle based storage structure for metadata elements of high level of granularity. The tool should be multilingual as well as support reuse of metadata elements within the same survey over time and across surveys.
 * The tool should provide DDI - Lifecycle and DDI-Codebook export and import possibilities to/from tools/web-services.
 * Communication between the three tools should be possible, involving a minimum of human interaction.
 * It should be possible to search the tool for concepts, questions and variable related elements (Boolean field level search).
 * Core module based on DDI components. A DDI profile will be developed for the tool, and Resource Packages will be specified.
 * The system should be open source.
 * User access rights should be provided.


### Software development status

The QVDB will be based on the QDDT, and will be developed when a stable production version of the QDDT is ready.
